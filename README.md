## (Containerization of V-Profile Project)
In this Project, we will see how to run our Vprofile application on containers. Now this project is more of a trailer of what is coming next in Docker.
Everything is ready made over here. We just need to bring up the VM and run our Vprofile containers on it.
In this project, we will see how these things will run on the container together. We are going to run this entire setup on a virtual machine.
So in the virtual machine, you will have all these containers running and we will access it. And we bring up the containers using the docker compose file.
